- **Staging Environment**: Automated deployments for testing and validation
- **Production Environment**: Controlled, reliable production deployments
- **GitHub Flow**: Enabled feature branch development with automated testing and deployment
- Automated CI/CD pipelines for each environment
- Environment-specific configuration management

### Code Review Process

Established code review practices and workflows:

- Defined review standards and best practices
- Integrated code review into the GitHub workflow
- Automated quality checks and testing before merge
- Knowledge sharing and team collaboration improvements
- Maintained code quality and consistency across the team

### AWS Infrastructure

Designed and implemented cloud infrastructure on AWS:

- **RDS**: Managed database services for reliable, scalable data storage
- **EC2**: Compute instances for application hosting and services
- Secure network configuration and access controls
- Automated backup and disaster recovery strategies
- Monitoring and alerting for infrastructure health

### MQTT Integration

Integrated MQTT messaging protocol for real-time communication:
