fullDescription: "ChenMed is on a mission to restore the doctor-patient relationship in modern healthcare, but their flagship web property wasn't doing a good enough job communicating that mission to physicians and patients. We worked with ChenMed to design and develop a robust component-driven site that better incorporated ChenMed's brand, while allowing the marketing team far more flexibility in building new pages to tell ChenMed's value-based care story."

## Project Overview

ChenMed needed a complete redesign of their flagship web property to better communicate their mission of restoring the doctor-patient relationship in modern healthcare to both physicians and patients.

> Components empower our marketing team to better tell our story the way we want while always maintaining brand consistency.

## Key Achievements

### Component-Driven Design

Created **27 swappable and standardized components** that can be used across **13 layouts** and look good on desktop and mobile. This component system empowers the marketing team to build new pages while maintaining brand consistency.

### Fast Delivery

ChenMed needed results fast, so we worked closely with their marketing and IT departments to redesign the site visually, architecturally and technically. The new site provides far more flexibility for the marketing team to tell ChenMed's value-based care story.

### Technical Architecture

Built on Drupal 8 with Vue.js, creating a modern, maintainable architecture that supports the component-driven approach while ensuring excellent performance and user experience.

## Results

- 27 reusable components across 13 layouts
- Improved brand communication to physicians and patients
- Enhanced marketing team flexibility
- Modern, maintainable technical architecture
