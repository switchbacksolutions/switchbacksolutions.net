> Our members are increasingly using mobile. Now our site reflects that reality.

## Key Achievements

### Custom Migration Plugin

We wrote a custom migration plugin to extract and transform old data to our new performance-optimized architecture. This allowed us to migrate over **50,000 items** seamlessly while maintaining data integrity.

### UX Overhaul

After an intimate discovery process with CLMP, we generated wireframes, component designs, and mockups to help steer the new design. The result was an elegant, mobile-friendly user experience that better serves their community of literary magazines and presses.

## Results

- Beautiful, responsive design optimized for mobile users
- Fast and navigable website with improved performance
- 50,000+ items successfully migrated
- Modern, maintainable architecture
