## Project Overview

The University of San Francisco needed to migrate their complex Drupal 7 Open Atrium intranet to Drupal 8 to address critical issues with usability, performance, extensibility, and maintainability.

## Key Challenges

### Complex Migration

One of the biggest challenges was migrating the existing Drupal 7 Organic Groups setup to utilize Drupal 8 Groups. Previously, there was no migration path that existed for this, however, we created one. Successfully migrated **250,000 entities** from the legacy system.

### Custom Functionality

On top of the Organic Group to Group migration, there was numerous other internal functionality that needed to be rebuilt, including:

- Custom user weighted draggable tables
- Integration and functionality with two internal APIs
- Custom CAS integration with the Group module

### Performance Optimization

We went through rigorous performance testing and tweaking of the custom functionality via New Relic, Blazemeter and Blackfire to ensure optimal performance for the university's intranet users.

## Results

- 250,000 entities successfully migrated
- Improved usability, performance, extensibility, and maintainability
- Created migration path for Drupal 7 Organic Groups to Drupal 8 Groups
- Custom functionality rebuilt and optimized
